		<p><strong>Q: Can you install an aftermarket stereo without cutting up my dashboard?</strong></p>
		<p>A: Yes. There are a number of companies that manufacture brackets and dashboard trim that exactly matches the original manufacturer trim and dashboard space of your vehicle. The only difference is that the opening in the replacement trim is made to fit the standard sizes of aftermarket radios. Your radio will sit perfectly still and be safe from the roads bumps and pot holes. (Car Stereos)</p>
		<p><strong>Q: What if you can't find a replacement carpet that fits my car?</strong></p>
		<p>There is no such thing as a carpet that won't fit. We can make any carpet fit your car, regardless of the size, material, or color of the carpet.</p>
		<p><strong>Q: How long does it take to have my auto carpet replaced?</strong></p>
		<p>A: It takes from 2 to 7 days to get the replacement carpet. We will notify you when we receive your new carpet and we will then schedule the installation. The installation takes 2 days.</p>
		<p><strong>Q: How long does it take to have my auto interior reupholstered?</strong></p>
		<p>A: As with auto carpets, it usually takes a day to get the material. In rare circumstances, it'll take 2 or 3 days. The whole installation job can be completed in a day in most cases.</p>
		<p><strong>Q: In addition to the warranty on labor, what additional warranties do I get for parts and products?</strong></p>
		<p>A: Leather upholstery is usually covered by a limited lifetime warranty for factory-related damage and defects. Most sunroof manufacturers also give a lifetime warranty. We will pass any warranty information and certificates on to you when your installation or repair is completed.</p>
