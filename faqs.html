              <br>
              Yes. There are a number of companies that manufacture brackets and dashboard trim that exactly matches the original manufacturer trim and dashboard space of your vehicle. The only difference is that the opening in the replacement trim is made to fit the standard sizes of aftermarket radios. Your radio will sit perfectly still and be safe from the roads bumps and pot holes.

              <br>
              The manufacturers of aftermarket premolded carpets don't usually invest the money in producing them until they feel there is a sufficient need. People don't start asking to have their carpets replaced until approximately 3 years after they purchase their car. This means that aftermarket premolded carpets are not available until approximately 3 years after a new model car hits the market. Keep in mind that we can always install an OEM (original equipment manufacturer) carpet for you which we (or you) get from the car dealership. The problem is that these carpets are usually at least twice the price. The other alternative, which we recommend, is a carpet with sewn seams. These carpets are custom fit to your vehicle by us and work just as well as the premolded carpets. In fact, this is the manner in which auto carpets were made for many years. You still get padding and have as many or more choices in colors. The only other difference is that we run small beads of glue in several places to hold the carpet in place. If you ever need to remove the carpet in the future, this glue is easily removed.

              <br>
              It takes from 2 to 7 days to get the replacement carpet. We will notify you when we receive your new carpet and we will then schedule the installation. The installation takes 2 days.

              <br>
              As with auto carpets, it takes from 2 to 7 days to get the material. The installation takes from 4 to 6 days depending on the type of vehicle.

              <br>
              Leather upholstery is usually covered by a limited lifetime warranty for factory-related damage and defects. Most sunroof manufacturers also give a lifetime warranty. We will pass any warranty information and certificates on to you when your installation or repair is completed.
